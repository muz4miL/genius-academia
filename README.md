## 📖 Overview

The **Edwardian Academy ERP** is a bespoke management solution designed to handle the complex financial flows of a multi-partner educational academy. Unlike generic LMS platforms, this system focuses on **Financial Integrity** and **Revenue Splitting**.

It features a strict **"End of Day Closing"** mechanism that acts like a digital bank vault—locking floating cash collected by partners and converting it into verified revenue for the central ledger.
